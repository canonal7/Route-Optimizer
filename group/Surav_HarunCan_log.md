On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 04.27.2020 - 05.03.2020 ~
Today I've created an Android Studio Project which is the foundation of mobile app.
I've added Main Screen, Settings and Enter Locations "Activities", which are the panels which the user will interact with.
I've decided to edit landscape layout in the final product because it borns from vertical layout but becomes completely disconnected from it after being born.
I've learned how to add listeners to buttons in Android Studio (touch more visual than that of Javas).
I've learned how to manipulate the manifest file of an android app.
I've played with the layout in order to improve the user experience.

// 04.27.2020
I've added an interface where the user can enter new locations by its X and Y coordinates, which will remain in the final product but probably be used mainly for testing purposes.
I've learned how to edit TextView's from java code in Android Studio.
I've tested whether X, Y Coordinate boxes work by printing the locations to terminal. 

// 04.28.2020
I helped Övgüm and Oğuz on algorithm, which they completely write from scratch after.

// 05.03.2020
All the group members (except Saad) demonstrated what they were doing.

### ~ 05.04.2020 - 05.11.2020 ~
I've learned how to read the context of a file without using a command prompt on Android Studio(by using InputStream and assets folder) and on PC Java(by using Scanner)
I've grasped the idea of catching errors by using try {} / catch {}.
