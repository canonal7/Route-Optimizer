Reflections G1F;

1- We thought the project was a useful learning experience
because it made us understand how a group of people can 
or should work on a single project and it made each one of us 
learn a new skill which we did not have before.

2- The main problems with our project work were that 
not everyone knew what they were supposed to do (as in how to 
implement or add new methods to map.), we organized very late,
it wasn't completely determined how to write the code before writing
it and had problems with integrating different parts because of that.
(The fact that we were stuck at home and couldn't meet did not help.)

3- The most difficult aspect of the project was the problem of communication
we had due to quarantine and the harm this situation had on our design.

4- We would come up with a stronger design with clearer instructions on how
different classes and methods should function so the integration part would be 
easier and neater.

5- We spent about a week on deciding the topic of the project. Then, another week
on how we can do it and what we can add to the project, another week on initial 
design. Last but not least 4 or 5 weeks writing and implementing the code. In terms of
hours we spent ~60 hours in total.

7- Yes, we are more proud of the process and and what we learned during the process rather 
than the final version of the project itself as we aimed for more features in the beggining.
However, we think the project is still fairly good.
